 * Description    : Left-outer joins two datasets, DBLP and CSX, based on their title.
 *                  DBLP has a secondary btree index on title, and given the 'indexnl' hint
 *                  we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *
 *                    TODO(@Sattam): given the 'indexnl' hint
 *                  we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *   
 *                    regression test for issue 285--having an order by for the outer loop relation
 * Success        : Yes
