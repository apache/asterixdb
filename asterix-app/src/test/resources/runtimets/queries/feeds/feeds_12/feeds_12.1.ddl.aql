 * Description  : Create a feed from the contents of  a file using a file_feed adaptor. 
                  The contents here contain a duplicate record. Since default ingestion policy requires the feed
                  to recover from failures, feed ingestion should be able to surpaas the tuple with duplicate key
                  without an abort. 
                  Verify that all but the duplicate record are inserted into the target dataset.
 * Expected Res : Success
 * Date         : 3rd Apr 2014
