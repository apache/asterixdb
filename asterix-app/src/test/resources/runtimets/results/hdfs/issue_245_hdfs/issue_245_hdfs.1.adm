{ "line": "ASTERIX is taking an open stance on data formats and addressing research issues including highly scalable data storage and indexing, semi-structured query processing on very large clusters, and merging parallel database techniques with todays data-intensive computing techniques to support performant yet declarative solutions to the problem of analyzing semi-structured information" }
{ "line": "ASTERIX targets a wide range of semi-structured information, ranging from data use cases where information is well-tagged and highly regular to content use cases where data is irregular and much of each datum is textual" }
{ "line": "The ASTERIX project is developing new technologies for ingesting, storing, managing, indexing, querying, analyzing, and subscribing to vast quantities of semi-structured information" }
{ "line": "The project is combining ideas from three distinct areas semi-structured data, parallel databases, and data-intensive computing  to create a next-generation, open source software platform that scales by running on large, shared-nothing commodity computing clusters" }
