 * Description    : Tests that the SimilarityCheckRule rewrites the edit-distance function with a threshold 
 *                  into edit-distance-check if possible.
 *                  Tests that the optimizer drills through the let clause.
 *                  Replacement should happen because of a "<=" condition on the edit distance.
 * Success        : Yes
