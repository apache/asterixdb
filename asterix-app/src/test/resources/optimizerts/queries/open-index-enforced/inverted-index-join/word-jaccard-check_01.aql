 * Description    : Fuzzy joins two datasets, DBLP and CSX, based on the similarity-jaccard-check function of their titles' word tokens.
 *                  DBLP has an enforced open keyword index on title, and we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 * Success        : Yes
