 * Description    : Tests whether an ngram_index index is applied to optimize a selection query using the similarity-edit-distance-check function on the substring of the field.
 *                  Tests that the optimizer rule correctly drills through the substring function.
 *                  The index should be applied.
 * Success        : Yes
