 * Description    : Tests whether an ngram_index is applied to optimize a selection query using the edit-distance-check function on strings.
 *                  Tests that the optimizer rule correctly drills through the let clauses.
 *                  The index should *not* be applied (see below).
 * Success        : Yes
