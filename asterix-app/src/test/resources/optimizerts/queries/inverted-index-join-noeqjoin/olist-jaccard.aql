/*
 * Description    : Fuzzy joins two datasets, Customer and Customer2, based on the similarity-jaccard function of their interest lists.
 *                  Customers has a keyword index on interests, and we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *                  We expect the top-level equi join introduced because of surrogate optimization to be removed, since it is not necessary.
 * Success        : Yes
