/*
 * Description    : Fuzzy joins two datasets, DBLP and CSX, based on the similarity-jaccard function of their titles' word tokens.
 *                  DBLP has a keyword index on title, and we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *                  We expect the top-level equi join introduced because of surrogate optimization to be removed, since it is not necessary.
 * Success        : Yes
