 * Description    : Equi joins two datasets, DBLP and CSX, based on their title.
 *                  DBLP has a secondary btree open index on title, and given the 'indexnl' hint
 *                  we *do not* expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join,
 *                  because CSX does not declare an enforced open index on field title.
 * Success        : Yes
