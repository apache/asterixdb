 * Description    : Fuzzy joins two datasets, DBLP and CSX, based the similarity-jaccard-check function of their titles' 3-gram tokens.
 *                  DBLP and CSX both have a 3-gram enforced open index on title, and we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 * Success        : Yes
