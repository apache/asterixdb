/*
 * Description    : Fuzzy joins two datasets, DBLP and CSX, based on the edit-distance-check function of their authors.
 *                  DBLP has a 3-gram enforced open index on authors, and we *do not* expect the join to be transformed
 *                  into an indexed nested-loop join, because CSX does not declare an enforced open index on field authors.
 * Success        : Yes
