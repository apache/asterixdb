/*
 * Description    : Fuzzy joins two datasets, Customers and Customers2, based on the edit-distance function of their interest lists.
 *                  Customers has a keyword index on interests, and we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *                  We test the inlining of variables that enable the select to be pushed into the join for subsequent optimization with an index.
 * Success        : Yes
