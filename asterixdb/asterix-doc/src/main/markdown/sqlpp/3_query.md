### SelectClause
**![](../images/diagrams/SelectClause.png)**


##### Synonyms for `VALUE`: `ELEMENT`, `RAW`
---

In a query block, the `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses (if present) are collectively called the Stream Generator. All these clauses, taken together, generate a stream of tuples of bound variables. The `SELECT` clause then uses these bound variables to generate the output of the query block.

For example, the clause `FROM customers AS c` scans over the `customers` collection, binding the variable `c` to each customer` object in turn, producing a stream of bindings.

Here's a slightly more complex example of a stream generator:

##### Example
	FROM customers AS c, orders AS o
	WHERE c.custid = o.custid

In this example, the `FROM` clause scans over the customers and orders collections, producing a stream of variable pairs (`c`, `o`) in which `c` is bound to a `customer` object and `o` is bound to an `order` object. The `WHERE` clause then retains only those pairs in which the custid values of the two objects match.

The output of the query block is a collection containing one output item for each tuple produced by the stream generator. If the stream generator produces no tuples, the output of the query block is an empty collection. Depending on the `SELECT` clause, each output item may be an object or some other kind of value.

In addition to using the variables bound by previous clauses, the `SELECT` clause may create and bind some additional variables. For example, the clause `SELECT salary + bonus AS pay` creates the variable `pay` and binds it to the value of `salary + bonus`. This variable may then be used in a later `ORDER BY` clause.

In SQL++, the `SELECT` clause may appear either at the beginning or at the end of a query block. Since the `SELECT` clause depends on variables that are bound in the other clauses, the examples in this section place `SELECT` at the end of the query blocks.

### <a id="Select_element">SELECT VALUE</a>


The `SELECT VALUE` clause returns an array or multiset that contains the results of evaluating the `VALUE` expression, with one evaluation being performed per "binding tuple" (i.e., per `FROM` clause item) satisfying the statement's selection criteria.
If there is no `FROM` clause, the expression after `VALUE` is evaluated once with no binding tuples
(except those inherited from an outer environment).

##### Example
(Q3.1)

    SELECT VALUE 1;

Result:

    [
       1
    ]

##### Example
(Q3.2) The following query returns the names of all customers whose rating is above 650.

    FROM customers AS c
    WHERE c.rating > 650
    SELECT VALUE name;

Result:

    RESULT:
    [
        "T. Cody",
        "M. Sinclair",
        "T. Henry"
    ]


### <a id="SQL_select">SQL-style SELECT</a>

Traditional SQL-style `SELECT` syntax is also supported in SQL++, however the result of a query is not guaranteed to preserve the order of expressions in the `SELECT` clause.

##### Example
(Q3.3) The following query returns the names and customers ids of any customers whose rating is 750.

    FROM customers AS c
    WHERE c.rating = 750
    SELECT c.name AS customer_name, c.custid AS customer_id;

Returns:

    [
        {
            "customer_id": "C13",
            "customer_name": "T. Cody"
        },
        {
            "customer_id": "C37",
            "customer_name": "T. Henry"
        }
    ]

### <a id="Select_star">SELECT *</a>

As in SQL, the phrase `SELECT *` suggests, "select everything."


For each binding tuple in the stream, `SELECT *` produces an output object. For each variable in the binding tuple, the output object contains a field: the name of the field is the name of the variable, and the value of the field is the value of the variable. Essentially, `SELECT *` means, "return all the bound variables, with their names and values."


The effect of `SELECT *` can be illustrated by an example based on two small collections named `ages` and `eyes`. The contents of the two collections are as follows:

`ages`:

	[
	    { "name": "Bill", "age": 21 },
	    { "name": "Sue", "age": 32 }
	]

`eyes`:

	[
	    { "name": "Bill", "eyecolor": "brown" },
	    { "name": "Sue", "eyecolor": "blue" }
	]

The following example applies `SELECT *` to a single collection.

##### Example

(Q3.4a) Return all the information in the `ages` collection.

	FROM ages AS a
	SELECT * ;

Result:

	[
	    { "a": { "name": "Bill", "age": 21 },
	    },
	    { "a": { "name": "Sue", "age": 32}
	    }
	]

Note that the variable-name `a` appears in the query result. If the `FROM` clause had been simply `FROM ages` (omitting `AS a`), the variable-name in the query result would have been `ages`.

The next example applies `SELECT *` to a join of two collections.

##### Example

(Q3.4b) Return all the information in a join of `ages` and `eyes` on matching name fields.

	FROM ages AS a, eyes AS e
	WHERE a.name = e.name
	SELECT * ;

Result:

	[
	    { "a": { "name": "Bill", "age": 21 },
	      "e": { "name": "Bill", "eyecolor": "Brown" }
	    },
	    { "a": { "name": "Sue", "age": 32 },
	      "e": { "name": "Sue", "eyecolor": "Blue" }
	    }
	]

Note that the result of `SELECT *` in SQL++ is more complex than the result of `SELECT *` in SQL.

### <a id="Select_variable_star">SELECT _variable_.*</a>

SQL++ has an alternative version of `SELECT *` in which the star is preceded by a variable. Whereas `SELECT *` means, "return all the bound variables, with their names and values," `SELECT` *variable* `.*` means "return only the named variable, and return only its value, not its name."

The following example can be compared with (Q3.4a) to see the difference between the two versions of `SELECT *`:

##### Example

(Q3.4c) Return all information in the `ages` collection.

	FROM ages AS a
	SELECT a.*

Result:

	[
	    { "name": "Bill", "age": 21 },
	    { "name": "Sue", "age": 32 }
	]

Note that, for queries over a single collection,  `SELECT` *variable* `.*` returns a simpler result and therefore may be preferable to `SELECT *`. In fact,  `SELECT` *variable* `.*`, like `SELECT *` in SQL, is equivalent to a `SELECT` clause that enumerates all the fields of the collection, as in (Q3.4d):

##### Example

(Q3.4d) Return all the information in the `ages` collection.

	FROM ages AS a
	SELECT a.name, a.age

(same result as (Q3.4c))

 `SELECT` *variable* `.*` has an additional application. It can be used to return all the fields of a nested object. To illustrate this use, we will use the `customers` dataset in the example database (see Appendix 4).

##### Example
(Q3.4e) In the `customers` dataset, return all the fields of the `address` objects that have zipcode "02340".

    FROM customers AS c
    WHERE c.address.zipcode = "02340"
    SELECT address.*  ;


Result:

    [
        {
            "street": "690 River St.",
            "city": "Hanover, MA",
            "zipcode": "02340"
        }
    ]


### <a id="Select_distinct">SELECT DISTINCT</a>
The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate duplicate items from the results of a query block.

##### Example

(Q3.5) Returns all of the different cities in the `customers` dataset.

    FROM customers AS c
    SELECT DISTINCT c.address.city;

Result:

    [
        {
            "city": "Boston, MA"
        },
        {
            "city": "Hanover, MA"
        },
        {
            "city": "St. Louis, MO"
        },
        {
            "city": "Rome, Italy"
        }
    ]

### <a id="Unnamed_projections">Unnamed Projections</a>
Similar to standard SQL, the query language supports unnamed projections (a.k.a, unnamed `SELECT` clause items), for which names are generated rather than user-provided.
Name generation has three cases:

  * If a projection expression is a variable reference expression, its generated name is the name of the variable.
  * If a projection expression is a field access expression, its generated name is the last identifier in the expression.
  * For all other cases, the query processor will generate a unique name.

##### Example

(Q3.6) Returns the last digit and the order date of all orders for the customer whose ID is "C41".

    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE o.custid = "C41"
    SELECT o.orderno % 1000,  o.order_date;

Result:

    [
        {
            "$1": 1,
            "order_date": "2020-04-29"
        },
        {
            "$1": 6,
            "order_date": "2020-09-02"
        }
    ]

In the result, `$1` is the generated name for `o.orderno % 1000`, while `order_date` is the generated name for `o.order_date`. It is good practice, however, to not rely on the randomly generated names which can be confusing and irrelevant. Instead, practice good naming conventions by providing a meaningful and concise name which properly describes the selected item.

### <a id="Abbreviated_field_access_expressions">Abbreviated Field Access Expressions</a>
As in standard SQL, field access expressions can be abbreviated when there is no ambiguity. In the next example, the variable `o` is the only possible variable reference for fields `orderno` and `order_date` and thus could be omitted in the query. This practice is not recommended, however, as queries may have fields (such as  `custid`) which can be present in multiple datasets. More information on abbbreviated field access can be found in the appendix section on Variable Resolution.

##### Example

(Q3.7) Same as Q3.6, omitting the variable reference for the order number and date and providing custom names for `SELECT` clause items.

    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE o.custid = "C41"
    SELECT orderno % 1000 AS last_digit, order_date;

Result:

    [
        {
            "last_digit": 1,
            "order_date": "2020-04-29"
        },
        {
            "last_digit": 6,
            "order_date": "2020-09-02"
        }
    ]

##### Synonyms for `UNNEST`: `CORRELATE`, `FLATTEN`
---

The purpose of a `FROM` clause is to iterate over a collection, binding a variable to each item in turn. Here's a query that iterates over the `customers` dataset, choosing certain customers and returning some of their attributes.

##### Example

(Q3.8) List the customer ids and names of the customers in zipcode 63101, in order by their customer IDs.



    FROM customers
    WHERE address.zipcode = "63101"
    SELECT custid AS customer_id, name
    ORDER BY customer_id;



Result:



    [
        {
            "customer_id": "C13",
            "name": "T. Cody"
        },
        {
            "customer_id": "C31",
            "name": "B. Pruitt"
        },
        {
            "customer_id": "C41",
            "name": "R. Dodge"
        }
    ]


Let's take a closer look at what this `FROM` clause is doing. A `FROM` clause always produces a stream of bindings, in which an iteration variable is bound in turn to each item in a collection. In Q3.8, since no explicit iteration variable is provided, the `FROM` clause defines an implicit variable named `customers`, the same name as the dataset that is being iterated over. The implicit iteration variable serves as the object-name for all field-names in the query block that do not have explicit object-names. Thus, `address.zipcode` really means `customers.address.zipcode`, `custid` really means `customers.custid`, and `name` really means `customers.name`.

You may also provide an explicit iteration variable, as in this version of the same query:

##### Example

(Q3.9) Alternative version of Q3.8 (same result).



    FROM customers AS c
    WHERE c.address.zipcode = "63101"
    SELECT c.custid AS customer_id, c.name
    ORDER BY customer_id;


In Q3.9, the variable `c` is bound to each `customer` object in turn as the query iterates over the `customers` dataset. An explicit iteration variable can be used to identify the fields of the referenced object, as in `c.name` in the `SELECT` clause of Q3.9. When referencing a field of an object, the iteration variable can be omitted when there is no ambiguity. For example, `c.name` could be replaced by `name` in the `SELECT` clause of Q3.9. That's why field-names like `name` and `custid` could stand by themselves in the Q3.8 version of this query.



In the examples above, the `FROM` clause iterates over the objects in a dataset. But in general, a `FROM` clause can iterate over any collection. For example, the objects in the `orders` dataset each contain a field called `items`, which is an array of nested objects. In some cases, you will write a `FROM` clause that iterates over a nested array like `items`.


The stream of objects (more accurately, variable bindings) that is produced by the `FROM` clause does not have any particular order. The system will choose the most efficient order for the iteration. If you want your query result to have a specific order, you must use an `ORDER BY` clause.


It's good practice to specify an explicit iteration variable for each collection in the `FROM` clause, and to use these variables to qualify the field-names in other clauses. Here are some reasons for this convention:


-   It's nice to have different names for the collection as a whole and an object in the collection. For example, in the clause `FROM customers AS c`, the name `customers` represents the dataset and the name `c` represents one object in the dataset.

-   In some cases, iteration variables are required. For example, when joining a dataset to itself, distinct iteration variables are required to distinguish the left side of the join from the right side.

-   In a subquery it's sometimes necessary to refer to an object in an outer query block (this is called a *correlated subquery*). To avoid confusion in correlated subqueries, it's best to use explicit variables.


### <a id="Left_outer_unnests">Joins</a>

A `FROM` clause gets more interesting when there is more than one collection involved. The following query iterates over two collections: `customers` and `orders`. The `FROM` clause produces a stream of binding tuples, each containing two variables, `c` and `o`. In each binding tuple, `c` is bound to an object from `customers`, and `o` is bound to an object from `orders`. Conceptually, at this point, the binding tuple stream contains all possible pairs of a customer and an order (this is called the *Cartesian product* of `customers` and `orders`). Of course, we are interested only in pairs where the `custid` fields match, and that condition is expressed in the `WHERE` clause, along with the restriction that the order number must be 1001.

##### Example

(Q3.10) Create a packing list for order number 1001, showing the customer name and address and all the items in the order.


    FROM customers AS c, orders AS o
    WHERE c.custid = o.custid
    AND o.orderno = 1001
    SELECT o.orderno,
        c.name AS customer_name,
        c.address,
        o.items AS items_ordered;


Result:

    [
        {
            "orderno": 1001,
            "customer_name": "R. Dodge",
            "address": {
                "street": "150 Market St.",
                "city": "St. Louis, MO",
                "zipcode": "63101"
            },
            "items_ordered": [
                {
                    "itemno": 347,
                    "qty": 5,
                    "price": 19.99
                },
                {
                    "itemno": 193,
                    "qty": 2,
                    "price": 28.89
                }
            ]
        }
    ]



Q3.10 is called a *join query* because it joins the `customers` collection and the `orders` collection, using the join condition `c.custid = o.custid`. In SQL++, as in SQL, you can express this query more explicitly by a `JOIN` clause that includes the join condition, as follows:


##### Example

(Q3.11) Alternative statement of Q3.10 (same result).


    FROM customers AS c JOIN orders AS o
        ON c.custid = o.custid
    WHERE o.orderno = 1001
    SELECT o.orderno,
        c.name AS customer_name,
        c.address,
        o.items AS items_ordered;


Whether you express the join condition in a `JOIN` clause or in a `WHERE` clause is a matter of taste; the result is the same. This manual will generally use a comma-separated list of collection-names in the `FROM` clause, leaving the join condition to be expressed elsewhere. As we'll soon see, in some query blocks the join condition can be omitted entirely.


There is, however, one case in which an explicit `JOIN` clause is necessary. That is when you need to join collection A to collection B, and you want to make sure that every item in collection A is present in the query result, even if it doesn't match any item in collection B. This kind of query is called a *left outer join*, and it is illustrated by the following example.

##### Example

(Q3.12) List the customer ID and name, together with the order numbers and dates of their orders (if any) of customers T. Cody and M. Sinclair.

    FROM customers AS c LEFT OUTER JOIN orders AS o ON c.custid = o.custid
    WHERE c.name = "T. Cody"
       OR c.name = "M. Sinclair"
    SELECT c.custid, c.name, o.orderno, o.order_date
    ORDER BY c.custid, o.order_date;



Result:

    [
        {
            "custid": "C13",
            "orderno": 1002,
            "name": "T. Cody",
            "order_date": "2020-05-01"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C13",
            "orderno": 1007,
            "name": "T. Cody",
            "order_date": "2020-09-13"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C13",
            "orderno": 1008,
            "name": "T. Cody",
            "order_date": "2020-10-13"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C13",
            "orderno": 1009,
            "name": "T. Cody",
            "order_date": "2020-10-13"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C25",
            "name": "M. Sinclair"
        }
    ]


As you can see from the result of this left outer join, our data includes four orders from customer T. Cody, but no orders from customer M. Sinclair. The behavior of left outer join in SQL++ is different from that of SQL. SQL would have provided M. Sinclair with an order in which all the fields were `null`. SQL++, on the other hand, deals with schemaless data, which permits it to simply omit the order fields from the outer join.

Now we're ready to look at a new kind of join that was not provided (or needed) in original SQL. Consider this query:

##### Example

(Q3.13) For every case in which an item is ordered in a quantity greater than 100, show the order number, date, item number, and quantity.



    FROM orders AS o, o.items AS i
    WHERE i.qty > 100
    SELECT o.orderno, o.order_date, i.itemno AS item_number,
        i.qty AS quantity
    ORDER BY o.orderno, item_number;

Result:

    [
        {
            "orderno": 1002,
            "order_date": "2020-05-01",
            "item_number": 680,
            "quantity": 150
        },
        {
            "orderno": 1005,
            "order_date": "2020-08-30",
            "item_number": 347,
            "quantity": 120
        },
        {
            "orderno": 1006,
            "order_date": "2020-09-02",
            "item_number": 460,
            "quantity": 120
        }
    ]


Q3.13 illustrates a feature called *left-correlation* in the `FROM` clause. Notice that we are joining `orders`, which is a dataset, to `items`, which is an array nested inside each order. In effect, for each order, we are unnesting the `items` array and joining it to the `order` as though it were a separate collection. For this reason, this kind of query is sometimes called an *unnesting query*. The keyword `UNNEST` may be used whenever left-correlation is used in a `FROM` clause, as shown in this example:



##### Example

(Q3.14) Alternative statement of Q3.13 (same result).

    FROM orders AS o UNNEST o.items AS i
    WHERE i.qty > 100
    SELECT o.orderno, o.order_date, i.itemno AS item_number,
            i.qty AS quantity
    ORDER BY o.orderno, item_number;


The results of Q3.13 and Q3.14 are exactly the same. `UNNEST` serves as a reminder that left-correlation is being used to join an object with its nested items. The join condition in Q3.14 is expressed by the left-correlation: each order `o` is joined to its own items, referenced as `o.items`. The result of the `FROM` clause is a stream of binding tuples, each containing two variables, `o` and `i`. The variable `o` is bound to an order and the variable `i` is bound to one item inside that order.

Like `JOIN`, `UNNEST` has a `LEFT OUTER` option. Q3.14 could have specified:



	FROM orders AS o LEFT OUTER UNNEST o.items AS i



In this case, orders that have no nested items would appear in the query result.

## <a id="Let_clauses">LET Clause</a>

### LetClause
**![](../images/diagrams/LetClause.png)**

##### Synonyms for `LET`: `LETTING`
---


 `LET` clauses can be useful when a (complex) expression is used several times within a query, allowing it to be written once to make the query more concise. The word `LETTING` can also be used, although this is not as common. The next query shows an example.

##### Example

(Q3.15) For each item in an order, the revenue is defined as the quantity times the price of that item. Find individual items for which the revenue is greater than 5000. For each of these, list the order number, item number, and revenue, in descending order by revenue.



    FROM orders AS o, o.items AS i
    LET revenue = i.qty * i.price
    WHERE revenue > 5000
    SELECT o.orderno, i.itemno, revenue
    ORDER by revenue desc;

Result:

    [
        {
            "orderno": 1006,
            "itemno": 460,
            "revenue": 11997.6
        },
        {
            "orderno": 1002,
            "itemno": 460,
            "revenue": 9594.05
        },
        {
            "orderno": 1006,
            "itemno": 120,
            "revenue": 5525
        }
    ]


The expression for computing revenue is defined once in the `LET` clause and then used three times in the remainder of the query. Avoiding repetition of the revenue expression makes the query shorter and less prone to errors.

## <a id="Where_having_clauses">WHERE Clause</a>

---

### WhereClause
**![](../images/diagrams/WhereClause.png)**


---

The purpose of a `WHERE` clause is to operate on the stream of binding tuples generated by the `FROM` clause, filtering out the tuples that do not satisfy a certain condition. The condition is specified by an expression based on the variable names in the binding tuples. If the expression evaluates to true, the tuple remains in the stream; if it evaluates to anything else, including `null` or `missing`, it is filtered out. The surviving tuples are then passed along to the next clause to be processed (usually either `GROUP BY` or `SELECT`).

Often, the expression in a `WHERE` clause is some kind of comparison like `quantity > 100`. However, any kind of expression is allowed in a `WHERE` clause. The only thing that matters is whether the expression returns `true` or not.


## <a id="Group_By_clauses">Grouping</a>

Grouping is especially important when manipulating hierarchies like the ones that are often found in JSON data. Often you will want to generate output data that includes both summary data and line items within the summaries. For this purpose, SQL++ supports several important extensions to the traditional grouping features of SQL. The familiar `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are still there, and they are joined by a new clause called `GROUP AS`. We'll illustrate these clauses by a series of examples.

### <a id="Left_outer_unnests">GROUP BY Clause</a>

---

### GroupByClause
**![](../images/diagrams/GroupByClause.png)**


---

We'll begin our discussion of grouping with an example from ordinary SQL.

##### Example

 (Q3.16) List the number of orders placed by each customer who has placed an order.

    SELECT o.custid, COUNT(o.orderno) AS `order count`
    FROM orders AS o
    GROUP BY o.custid
    ORDER BY o.custid;

 Result:

    [
        {
            "order count": 4,
            "custid": "C13"
        },
        {
            "order count": 1,
            "custid": "C31"
        },
        {
            "order count": 1,
            "custid": "C35"
        },
        {
            "order count": 1,
            "custid": "C37"
        },
        {
            "order count": 2,
            "custid": "C41"
        }
    ]
 The input to a `GROUP BY` clause is the stream of binding tuples generated by the `FROM` and `WHERE`clauses. In this query, before grouping, the variable `o` is bound to each object in the `orders` collection in turn.

 SQL++ evaluates the expression in the `GROUP BY` clause, called the grouping expression, once for each of the binding tuples. It then organizes the results into groups in which the grouping expression has a common value (as defined by the `=` operator). In this example, the grouping expression is `o.custid`, and each of the resulting groups is a set of `orders` that have the same `custid`. If necessary, a group is formed for `orders` in which `custid` is `null`, and another group is formed for `orders` that have no `custid`. This query uses the aggregating function `COUNT(o.orderno)`, which counts how many order numbers are in each group. If we are sure that each order object has a distinct `orderno`, we could also simply count the order objects in each group by using `COUNT(*)` in place of `COUNT(o.orderno)`.

In the `GROUP BY`clause, you may optionally define an alias for the grouping expression. For example, in Q3.16, you could have written `GROUP BY o.custid AS cid`. The alias `cid` could then be used in place of the grouping expression in later clauses. In cases where the grouping expression contains an operator, it is especially helpful to define an alias (for example, `GROUP BY salary + bonus AS pay)`.

 Q3.16 had a single grouping expression, `o.custid`. If a query has multiple grouping expressions, the combination of grouping expressions is evaluated for every binding tuple, and the stream of binding tuples is partitioned into groups that have values in common for all of the grouping expressions. We'll see an example of such a query in Q3.18.


After grouping, the number of binding tuples is reduced: instead of a binding tuple for each of the input objects, there is a binding tuple for each group. The grouping expressions (identified by their aliases, if any) are bound to the results of their evaluations. However, all the non-grouping fields (that is, fields that were not named in the grouping expressions), are accessible only in a special way: as an argument of one of the special aggregation pseudo-functions such as: `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `STDEV` and `COUNT`. The clauses that come after grouping can access only properties of groups, including the grouping expressions and aggregate properties of the groups such as `COUNT(o.orderno)` or `COUNT(*)`. (We'll see an exception when we discuss the new `GROUP AS` clause.)

You may notice that the results of Q3.16 do not include customers who have no `orders`. If we want to include these `customers`, we need to use an outer join between the `customers` and `orders` collections. This is illustrated by the following example, which also includes the name of each customer.

##### Example

 (Q3.17) List the number of orders placed by each customer including those customers who have placed no orders.

    SELECT c.custid, c.name, COUNT(o.orderno) AS `order count`
    FROM customers AS c LEFT OUTER JOIN orders AS o ON c.custid = o.custid
    GROUP BY c.custid, c.name
    ORDER BY c.custid;

 Result:

    [
        {
            "custid": "C13",
            "order count": 4,
            "name": "T. Cody"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C25",
            "order count": 0,
            "name": "M. Sinclair"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C31",
            "order count": 1,
            "name": "B. Pruitt"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C35",
            "order count": 1,
            "name": "J. Roberts"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C37",
            "order count": 1,
            "name": "T. Henry"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C41",
            "order count": 2,
            "name": "R. Dodge"
        },
        {
            "custid": "C47",
            "order count": 0,
            "name": "S. Logan"
        }
    ]


Notice in Q3.17 what happens when the special aggregation function `COUNT` is applied to a collection that does not exist, such as the orders of M. Sinclair: it returns zero. This behavior is unlike that of the other special aggregation functions `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN`, which return `null` if their operand does not exist. This should make you cautious about the `COUNT` function: If it returns zero, that may mean that the collection you are counting has zero members, or that it does not exist, or that you have misspelled the collection's name.

Q3.17 also shows how a query block can have more than one grouping expression. In general, the `GROUP BY`clause produces a binding tuple for each different combination of values for the grouping expressions. In Q3.17, the `c.custid` field uniquely identifies a customer, so adding `c.name` as a grouping expression does not result in any more groups. Nevertheless, `c.name` must be included as a grouping expression if it is to be referenced outside (after) the `GROUP BY` clause. If `c.name` were not included in the `GROUP BY` clause, it would not be a group property and could not be used in the `SELECT` clause.

Of course, a grouping expression need not be a simple field-name. In Q3.18, orders are grouped by month, using a temporal function to extract the month component of the order dates. In cases like this, it is helpful to define an alias for the grouping expression so that it can be referenced elsewhere in the query e.g. in the `SELECT` clause.

##### Example

(Q3.18) Find the months in 2020 that had the largest numbers of orders; list the months and their numbers of orders. (Return the top three.)

    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE get_year(date(o.order_date)) = 2020
    GROUP BY get_month(date(o.order_date)) AS month
    SELECT month, COUNT(*) AS order_count
    ORDER BY order_count desc
    LIMIT 3;

Result:

    [
        {
            "month": 10,
            "order_count": 2
        },
        {
            "month": 9,
            "order_count": 2
        },
        {
            "month": 8,
            "order_count": 1
        }
    ]

Groups are commonly formed from named collections like `customers` and `orders`. But in some queries you need to form groups from a collection that is nested inside another collection, such as `items` inside `orders`. In SQL++ you can do this by using left-correlation in the `FROM` clause to unnest the inner collection, joining the inner collection with the outer collection, and then performing the grouping on the join, as illustrated in Q3.19.

Q3.19 also shows how a `LET` clause can be used after a `GROUP BY` clause to define an expression that is referenced multiple times in later clauses.

##### Example

(Q3.19) For each order, define the total revenue of the order as the sum of quantity times price for all the items in that order. List the total revenue for all the orders placed by the customer with id "C13", in descending order by total revenue.


    FROM orders as o, o.items as i
    WHERE o.custid = "C13"
    GROUP BY o.orderno
    LET total_revenue = sum(i.qty * i.price)
    SELECT o.orderno, total_revenue
    ORDER BY total_revenue desc;

Result:

    [
        {
            "orderno": 1002,
            "total_revenue": 10906.55
        },
        {
            "orderno": 1008,
            "total_revenue": 1999.8
        },
        {
            "orderno": 1007,
            "total_revenue": 130.45
        }
    ]

### <a id="Left_outer_unnests">HAVING Clause</a>

---

### HavingClause
**![](../images/diagrams/HavingClause.png)**


---

The `HAVING` clause is very similar to the `WHERE` clause, except that it comes after `GROUP BY` and applies a filter to groups rather than to individual objects. Here's an example of a `HAVING` clause that filters orders by applying a condition to their nested arrays of `items`.

By adding a `HAVING` clause to Q3.19, we can filter the results to include only those orders whose total revenue is greater than 1000, as shown in Q3.22.


##### Example

(Q3.20) Modify Q3.19 to include only orders whose total revenue is greater than 5000.

    FROM orders AS o, o.items as i
    WHERE o.custid = "C13"
    GROUP BY o.orderno
    LET total_revenue = sum(i.qty * i.price)
    HAVING total_revenue > 5000
    SELECT o.orderno, total_revenue
    ORDER BY total_revenue desc;

Result:

    [
        {
            "orderno": 1002,
            "total_revenue": 10906.55
        }
    ]

### <a id="Aggregation_PseudoFunctions">Aggregation Pseudo-Functions</a>

SQL provides several special functions for performing aggregations on groups including: `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `COUNT` (some implementations provide more). These same functions are supported in SQL++. However, it's worth spending some time on these special functions because they don't behave like ordinary functions. They are called "pseudo-functions" here because they don't evaluate their operands in the same way as ordinary functions. To see the difference, consider these two examples, which are syntactically similar:

##### Example 1:

    SELECT LENGTH(name) FROM customers

  In Example 1, `LENGTH` is an ordinary function. It simply evaluates its operand (name) and then returns a result computed from the operand.

##### Example 2:
    SELECT AVG(rating) FROM customers

The effect of `AVG` in Example 2 is quite different. Rather than performing a computation on an individual rating value, `AVG` has a global effect: it effectively restructures the query. As a pseudo-function, `AVG` requires its operand to be a group; therefore, it automatically collects all the rating values from the query block and forms them into a group.

The aggregation pseudo-functions always require their operand to be a group. In some queries, the group is explicitly generated by a `GROUP BY` clause, as in Q3.21:
##### Example
  (Q3.21) List the average credit rating of customers by zipcode.

    FROM customers AS c
    GROUP BY c.address.zipcode AS zip
    SELECT zip, AVG(c.rating) AS `avg credit rating`
    ORDER BY zip;

 Result:

    [
        {
            "avg credit rating": 625
        },
        {
            "avg credit rating": 657.5,
            "zip": "02115"
        },
        {
            "avg credit rating": 690,
            "zip": "02340"
        },
        {
            "avg credit rating": 695,
            "zip": "63101"
        }
    ]

Note in the result of Q3.21 that one or more customers had no zipcode. These customers were formed into a group for which the value of the grouping key is missing. When the query results were returned in JSON format, the `missing` key simply does not appear. Also note that the group whose key is `missing` appears first because `missing` is considered to be smaller than any other value. If some customers had had `null` as a zipcode, they would have been included in another group, appearing after the `missing` group but before the other groups.

When an aggregation pseudo-function is used without an explicit `GROUP BY` clause, it implicitly forms the entire query block into a single group, as in Q3.22:
##### Example
(Q3.22) Find the average credit rating among all customers.



    FROM customers AS c
    SELECT AVG(c.rating) AS `avg credit rating`;

Result:

    [
        {
            "avg credit rating": 670
        }
    ]



The aggregation pseudo-function `COUNT` has a special form in which its operand is `*` instead of an expression. For example, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers` simply returns the total number of customers, whereas `SELECT COUNT(rating) FROM customers` returns the number of customers who have known ratings (that is, their ratings are not `null` or `missing`).



 Because the aggregation pseudo-functions sometimes restructure their operands, they can be used only in query blocks where (explicit or implicit) grouping is being done. Therefore the pseudo-functions cannot operate directly on arrays or multisets. For operating directly on JSON collections, SQL++ provides a set of ordinary functions for computing aggregations. Each ordinary aggregation function (except the ones corresponding to `COUNT` and `ARRAY_AGG`) has two versions: one that ignores `null` and `missing` values and one that returns `null` if a `null` or `missing` value is encountered anywhere in the collection. The names of the aggregation functions are as follows:

| Aggregation pseudo-function; operates on groups only |  ordinary functions: Ignores NULL or MISSING values | ordinary functions: Returns NULL if NULL or MISSING are encountered|
|----------|----------|--------|
|SUM| ARRAY_SUM| STRICT_SUM |
| AVG |ARRAY_MAX| STRICT_MAX |
| MAX | ARRAY_MIN| STRICT_MIN |
| MIN | ARRAY_AVG| STRICT_AVG |
| COUNT        |ARRAY_COUNT|STRICT_COUNT (see exception below) |
|STDDEV_SAMP|ARRAY_STDDEV_SAMP| STRICT_STDDEV_SAMP |
|STDDEV_POP|ARRAY_STDDEV_POP| STRICT_STDDEV_POP |
|VAR_SAMP|ARRAY_VAR_SAMP| STRICT_VAR_SAMP |
|VAR_POP|ARRAY_VAR_POP| STRICT_VAR_POP |
|SKEWENESS|ARRAY_SKEWNESS| STRICT_SKEWNESS |
|KURTOSIS|ARRAY_KURTOSIS| STRICT_KURTOSIS |
||ARRAY_AGG||||


##### Exception: the ordinary aggregation function STRICT_COUNT operates on any collection, and returns a count of its items, including null values in the count. In this respect, STRICT_COUNT is more similar to COUNT(*) than to COUNT(expression).

 Note that the ordinary aggregation functions that ignore `null` have names beginning with "ARRAY." This naming convention has historical roots. Despite their names, the functions operate on both arrays and multisets.



Because of the special properties of the aggregation pseudo-functions, SQL (and therefore SQL++) is not a pure functional language. But every query that uses a pseudo-function can be expressed as an equivalent query that uses an ordinary function. Q3.23 is an example of how queries can be expressed without pseudo-functions. A more detailed explanation of all of the functions is also available [here](builtins.html#AggregateFunctions) .

##### Example

 (Q3.23) Alternative form of Q3.22, using the ordinary function `ARRAY_AVG` rather than the aggregating pseudo-function `AVG`.



    SELECT ARRAY_AVG(
        (SELECT VALUE c.rating
        FROM customers AS c) ) AS `avg credit rating`;

 Result (same as Q3.22):


    [
        {
            "avg credit rating": 670
        }
    ]

If the function `STRICT_AVG` had been used in Q3.23 in place of `ARRAY_AVG`, the average credit rating returned by the query would have been `null`, because at least one customer has no credit rating.



### <a id="Left_outer_unnests">GROUP AS Clause</a>

---

### GroupAsClause
**![](../images/diagrams/GroupAsClause.png)**


---

JSON is a hierarchical format, and a fully featured JSON query language needs to be able to produce hierarchies of its own, with computed data at every level of the hierarchy. The key feature of SQL++ that makes this possible is the `GROUP AS` clause.



A query may have a `GROUP AS` clause only if it has a `GROUP BY` clause. The `GROUP BY` clause "hides" the original objects in each group, exposing only the grouping expressions and special aggregation functions on the non-grouping fields. The purpose of the `GROUP AS` clause is to make the original objects in the group visible to subsequent clauses. Thus the query can generate output data both for the group as a whole and for the individual objects inside the group.



For each group, the `GROUP AS` clause preserves all the objects in the group, just as they were before grouping, and gives a name to this preserved group. The group name can then be used in the `FROM` clause of a subquery to process and return the individual objects in the group.



To see how this works, we'll write some queries that investigate the customers in each zipcode and their credit ratings. This would be a good time to review the sample database in Appendix 4. A part of the data is summarized below.

    Customers in zipcode 02115:
        C35, J. Roberts, rating 565
        C37, T. Henry, rating 750

    Customers in zipcode 02340:
        C25, M. Sinclair, rating 690

    Customers in zipcode 63101:
        C13, T. Cody, rating 750
        C31, B. Pruitt, (no rating)
        C41, R. Dodge, rating 640

    Customers with no zipcode:
        C47, S. Logan, rating 625



Now let's consider the effect of the following clauses:

    FROM customers AS c
    GROUP BY c.address.zipcode
    GROUP AS g

This query fragment iterates over the `customers` objects, using the iteration variable `c`. The `GROUP BY` clause forms the objects into groups, each with a common zipcode (including one group for customers with no zipcode). After the `GROUP BY` clause, we can see the grouping expression, `c.address.zipcode`, but other fields such as `c.custid` and `c.name` are visible only to special aggregation functions.

The clause `GROUP AS g` now makes the original objects visible again. For each group in turn, the variable `g` is bound to a multiset of objects, each of which has a field named `c`, which in turn contains one of the original objects. Thus after `GROUP AS g`, for the group with zipcode 02115, `g` is bound to the following multiset:


    [
        { "c":
            { "custid": "C35",
              "name": "J. Roberts",
              "address":
                { "street": "420 Green St.",
                  "city": "Boston, MA",
                  "zipcode": "02115"
                },
              "rating": 565
            }
        },
        { "c":
            { "custid": "C37",
              "name": "T. Henry",
              "address":
                { "street": "120 Harbor Blvd.",
                  "city": "St. Louis, MO",
                  "zipcode": "02115"
                },
              "rating": 750
            }
        }
    ]



Thus, the clauses following `GROUP AS` can see the original objects by writing subqueries that iterate over the multiset `g`.

The extra level named `c` was introduced into this multiset because the groups might have been formed from a join of two or more collections. Suppose that the `FROM` clause looked like `FROM customers AS c, orders AS o`. Then each item in the group would contain both a `customers` object and an `orders` object, and these two objects might both have a field with the same name. To avoid ambiguity, each of the original objects is wrapped in an "outer" object that gives it the name of its iteration variable in the `FROM` clause. Consider this fragment:

    FROM customers AS c, orders AS o
    WHERE c.custid = o.custid
    GROUP BY c.address.zipcode
    GROUP AS g

In this case, following `GROUP AS g`, the variable `g` would be bound to the following collection:

    [
        { "c": { an original customers object },
          "o": { an original orders object }
        },
        { "c": { another customers object },
          "o": { another orders object }
        },
        ...
    ]

After using `GROUP AS` to make the content of a group accessible, you will probably want to write a subquery to access that content. A subquery for this purpose is written in exactly the same way as any other subquery. The name  specified in the `GROUP AS` clause (`g` in the above example) is the name of a collection of objects. You can write a `FROM` clause to iterate over the objects in the collection, and you can specify an iteration variable to represent each object in turn. For `GROUP AS` queries in this manual, I'll use `g`as the name of the reconstituted group, and `gi` as an iteration variable representing one object inside the group. Of course, you can use any names you like for these purposes.

Now we are ready to take a look at how `GROUP AS` might be used in a query. Suppose that we want to group customers by zipcode, and for each group we want to see the average credit rating and a list of the individual customers in the group. Here's a query that does that:

##### Example
(Q3.24) For each zipcode, list the average credit rating in that zipcode, followed by the customer numbers and names in numeric order.

    FROM customers AS c
    GROUP BY c.address.zipcode AS zip
    GROUP AS g
    SELECT zip, AVG(c.rating) AS `avg credit rating`,
        (FROM g AS gi
         SELECT gi.c.custid, gi.c.name
         ORDER BY gi.c.custid) AS `local customers`
    ORDER BY zip;

Result:

    [
        {
            "avg credit rating": 625,
            "local customers": [
                {
                    "custid": "C47",
                    "name": "S. Logan"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "avg credit rating": 657.5,

Note that this query contains two `ORDER BY` clauses: one in the outer query and one in the subquery. These two clauses govern the ordering of the outer-level list of zipcodes and the inner-level lists of customers, respectively. Also note that the group of customers with no zipcode comes first in the output list. For additional reading on SQL++ and more examples using `GROUP AS`  as well as other clauses discussed in this manual see the [SQL++ Tutorial](https://asterixdb.apache.org/files/SQL_Book.pdf).

## <a id="Union_all">Selection and UNION ALL</a>

---
### Selection
**![](../images/diagrams/Selection.png)**

### UnionOption
**![](../images/diagrams/UnionOption.png)**

---

In a SQL++ query, two or more query blocks can be connected by the operator `UNION ALL`. The result of a `UNION ALL` between two query blocks contains all the items returned by the first query block, and all the items returned by the second query block. Duplicate items are not eliminated from the query result.

As in SQL, there is no ordering guarantee on the contents of the output stream. However, unlike SQL, the query language does not constrain what the data looks like on the input streams; in particular, it allows heterogeneity on the input and output streams. A type error will be raised if one of the inputs is not a collection.

When two or more query blocks are connected by `UNION ALL`, they can be followed by `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `OFFSET` clauses that apply to the `UNION` query as a whole. For these clauses to be meaningful, the field-names returned by the two query blocks should match. The following example shows a `UNION ALL` of two query blocks, with an ordering specified for the result.

In this example, a customer might be selected because he has ordered more than two different items (first query block) or because he has a high credit rating (second query block). By adding an explanatory string to each query block, the query writer can cause the output objects to be labeled to distinguish these two cases.



##### Example

(Q3.25a) Find customer ids for customers who have placed orders for more than two different items or who have a credit rating greater than 700, with labels to distinguish these cases.



	FROM orders AS o, o.items AS i
	GROUP BY o.orderno, o.custid
	HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
	SELECT DISTINCT o.custid AS customer_id, "Big order" AS reason

	UNION ALL

	FROM customers AS c
	WHERE rating > 700
	SELECT c.custid AS customer_id, "High rating" AS reason
	ORDER BY customer_id;

Result:


	[
	    {
	        "reason": "High rating",
	        "customer_id": "C13"
	    },
	    {
	        "reason": "Big order",
	        "customer_id": "C37"
	    },
	    {
	        "reason": "High rating",
	        "customer_id": "C37"
	    },
	    {
	        "reason": "Big order",
	        "customer_id": "C41"
	    }
	]



If, on the other hand, you simply want a list of the customer ids and you don't care to preserve the reasons, you can simplify your output by using `SELECT VALUE`, as follows:



(Q3.25b) Simplify Q3.25a to return a simple list of unlabeled customer ids.



	FROM orders AS o, o.items AS i
	GROUP BY o.orderno, o.custid
	HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
	SELECT VALUE o.custid

	UNION ALL

	FROM customers AS c
	WHERE rating > 700
	SELECT VALUE c.custid;

Result:

	[
	    "C37",
	    "C41",
	    "C13",
	    "C37"
	]

## <a id="With_clauses">WITH Clause</a>

---

### WithClause
**![](../images/diagrams/WithClause.png)**


---

As in standard SQL, a `WITH` clause can be used to improve the modularity of a query. A `WITH` clause often contains a subquery that is needed to compute some result that is used later in the main query. In cases like this, you can think of the `WITH` clause as computing a “temporary view" of the input data. The next example uses a `WITH` clause to compute the total revenue of each order in 2020; then the main part of the query finds the minimum, maximum, and average revenue for orders in that year.

##### Example

(Q3.26) Find the minimum, maximum, and average revenue among all orders in 2020, rounded to the nearest integer.

    WITH order_revenue AS
        (FROM orders AS o, o.items AS i
        WHERE get_year(date(o.order_date)) = 2020
        GROUP BY o.orderno
        SELECT o.orderno, SUM(i.qty * i.price) AS revenue
      )
    FROM order_revenue
    SELECT AVG(revenue) AS average,
	       MIN(revenue) AS minimum,
           MAX(revenue) AS maximum;


Result:

    [
        {
            "average": 4669.99,
            "minimum": 130.45,
            "maximum": 18847.58
        }
    ]

`WITH` can be particularly useful when a value needs to be used several times in a query.

## <a id="Order_By_clauses">ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET Clauses</a>

---
### OrderbyClause
**![](../images/diagrams/OrderbyClause.png)**

### LimitClause
**![](../images/diagrams/LimitClause.png)**

### OffsetClause
**![](../images/diagrams/OffsetClause.png)**
---

The last three (optional) clauses to be processed in a query are `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `OFFSET`.

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to globally sort data in either ascending order (i.e., `ASC`) or descending order (i.e., `DESC`).
During ordering, `MISSING` and `NULL` are treated as being smaller than any other value if they are encountered
in the ordering key(s). `MISSING` is treated as smaller than `NULL` if both occur in the data being sorted.
The ordering of values of a given type is consistent with its type's `<=` ordering; the ordering of values across types is implementation-defined but stable.

The `LIMIT` clause is used to limit the result set to a specified maximum size.
The optional `OFFSET` clause is used to specify a number of items in the output stream to be discarded before the query result begins.
The `OFFSET` can also be used as a standalone clause, without the `LIMIT`.

The following example illustrates use of the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses.

##### Example
(Q3.27) Return the top three customers by rating.

    FROM customers AS c
    SELECT c.custid, c.name, c.rating
    ORDER BY c.rating DESC
    LIMIT 3;

Result:

    [
        {
            "custid": "C13",
            "name": "T. Cody",
            "rating": 750
        },
        {
            "custid": "C37",
            "name": "T. Henry",
            "rating": 750
        },
        {
            "custid": "C25",
            "name": "M. Sinclair",
            "rating": 690
        }
    ]

The following example illustrates the use of `OFFSET`:

##### Example

(Q3.38) Find the customer with the third-highest credit rating.

    FROM customers AS c
    SELECT c.custid, c.name, c.rating
    ORDER BY c.rating DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
Result:

    [
        {
            "custid": "C25",
            "name": "M. Sinclair",
            "rating": 690
        }
    ]



## <a id="Subqueries">Subqueries</a>

---

### Subquery
**![](../images/diagrams/Subquery.png)**


---

A subquery is simply a query surrounded by parentheses. In SQL++, a subquery can appear anywhere that an expression can appear. Like any query, a subquery always returns a collection, even if the collection contains only a single value or is empty. If the subquery has a SELECT clause, it returns a collection of objects. If the subquery has a SELECT VALUE clause, it returns a collection of scalar values. If a single scalar value is expected, the indexing operator [0] can be used to extract the single scalar value from the collection.

##### Example

(Q3.29)(Subquery in SELECT clause)
For every order that includes item no. 120, find the order number, customer id, and customer name.

Here, the subquery is used to find a customer name, given a customer id. Since the outer query expects a scalar result, the subquery uses SELECT VALUE and is followed by the indexing operator [0].

    FROM orders AS o, o.items AS i
    WHERE i.itemno = 120
    SELECT o.orderno, o.custid,
        (FROM customers AS c
         WHERE c.custid = o.custid
         SELECT VALUE c.name)[0] AS name;

Result:

    [
        {
            "orderno": 1003,
            "custid": "C31",
            "name": "B. Pruitt"
        },
        {
            "orderno": 1006,
            "custid": "C41",
            "name": "R. Dodge"
        }
    ]

##### Example

(Q3.30) (Subquery in WHERE clause)
Find the customer number, name, and rating of all customers whose rating is greater than the average rating.

Here, the subquery is used to find the average rating among all customers. Once again, SELECT VALUE and indexing [0] have been used to get a single scalar value.


    FROM customers AS c1
    WHERE c1.rating >
       (FROM customers AS c2
        SELECT VALUE AVG(c2.rating))[0]
    SELECT c1.custid, c1.name, c1.rating;
Result:

    [
        {
            "custid": "C13",
            "name": "T. Cody",
            "rating": 750
        },
        {
            "custid": "C25",
            "name": "M. Sinclair",
            "rating": 690
        },
        {
            "custid": "C37",
            "name": "T. Henry",
            "rating": 750
        }
    ]


##### Example

(Q3.31) (Subquery in FROM clause)
Compute the total revenue (sum over items of quantity time price) for each order, then find the average, maximum, and minimum total revenue over all orders.

Here, the FROM clause expects to iterate over a collection of objects, so the subquery uses an ordinary SELECT and does not need to be indexed. You might think of a FROM clause as a "natural home" for a subquery.

    FROM
       (FROM orders AS o, o.items AS i
        GROUP BY o.orderno
        SELECT o.orderno, SUM(i.qty * i.price) AS revenue
       ) AS r
    SELECT AVG(r.revenue) AS average,
	       MIN(r.revenue) AS minimum,
	       MAX(r.revenue) AS maximum;

Result:

    [
        {
            "average": 4669.99,
	        "minimum": 130.45,
            "maximum": 18847.58
        }
    ]

Note the similarity between Q3.26 and Q3.31. This illustrates how a subquery can often be moved into a `WITH` clause to improve the modularity and readability of a query.
