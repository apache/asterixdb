 * Description    : Tests that the SimilarityCheckRule rewrites the edit-distance function with a threshold
 *                  into edit-distance-check if possible.
 *                  Replacement should *not* happen because of a reverse ">=" condition on the edit distance.
 * Success        : Yes
