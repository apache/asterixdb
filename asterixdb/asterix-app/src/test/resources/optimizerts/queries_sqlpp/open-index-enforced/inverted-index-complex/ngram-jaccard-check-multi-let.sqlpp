 * Description    : Tests whether an ngram_index is applied to optimize a selection query using the similarity-jaccard-check function on 3-gram tokens.
 *                  Tests that the optimizer rule correctly drills through the let clauses.
 *                  The index should be applied.
 * Success        : Yes
