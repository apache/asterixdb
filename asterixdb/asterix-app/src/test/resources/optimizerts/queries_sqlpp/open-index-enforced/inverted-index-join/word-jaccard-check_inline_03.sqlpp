 * Description    : Fuzzy self joins a dataset, DBLP, based on the similarity-jaccard-check function of its titles' word tokens.
 *                  DBLP has an enforced open keyword index on title?, and we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *                  We test the inlining of variables that enable the select to be pushed into the join for subsequent optimization with an index.
 * Success        : Yes
