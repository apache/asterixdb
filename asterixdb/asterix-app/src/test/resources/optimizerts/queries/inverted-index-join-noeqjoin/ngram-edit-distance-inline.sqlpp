/*
 * Description    : Fuzzy self joins a dataset, DBLP, based on the edit-distance function of its authors.
 *                  DBLP has a 3-gram index on authors, and we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *                  We test the inlining of variables that enable the select to be pushed into the join for subsequent optimization with an index.
 *                  We expect the top-level equi join introduced because of surrogate optimization to be removed, since it is not necessary.
 * Success        : Yes
