 * Description  : Test that left-outer-join may use two available indexes, one for primary index in prob subtree
 *              : and another for secondary btree index in index subtree.
 *              : In fact, this is an index-only plan from the inner branch's perspective since only PK and SK
 *              : variables are used and returned.
 * Issue        : 730, 741
 * Expected Res : Success
 * Date         : 8th May 2014
