 * Description    : Equi joins two datasets, FacebookUsers and FacebookMessages, based on their user's id.
 *                  We first expect FacebookUsers' primary index to be used
 *                  to satisfy the range condition on it's primary key.
 *                  FacebookMessages has a secondary btree open index on author-id-copy, and given the 'indexnl' hint
 *                  we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 * Success        : Yes
