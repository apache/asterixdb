 * Description    : Tests whether an ngram_index is applied to optimize a selection query using
 *                  two edit-distance-check function of which only the second can be optimized with an index.
 *                  Tests that the optimizer rule correctly drills through the let clauses.
 *                  The index should be applied.
 * Success        : Yes
