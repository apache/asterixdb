/*
 *  Description     : Secondary BTree Index index-only selection plan verification test
 *                  : The test is intended to verify that the secondary BTree index is used in the optimized query plan.
 *                  : In this plan, we fetch PK and SK based on a select condition that utilizes a secondary index.
 *                  : The plan should have two paths after the secondary index-lookup.
 *                  : The left path:
 *                      ... -> unnest-map (sidx) -> split -> unnest-map (pidx) -> select -> union -> ...
 *                  : The right path:
 *                      ... -> unnest-map (sidx) -> split ->                             -> union -> ...
 *                  : However, we set the `compiler.index.covering` option to false. So, the index-only plan should not be triggered.
 *  Expected Result : Success
