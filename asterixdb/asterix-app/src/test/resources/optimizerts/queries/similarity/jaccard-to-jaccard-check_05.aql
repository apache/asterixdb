 * Description    : Tests that the SimilarityCheckRule rewrites the similarity-jaccard function with a threshold 
 *                  into similarity-jaccard-check-check if possible.
 *                  Replacement should *not* happen because of a "<=" condition on the similarity.
 * Success        : Yes
