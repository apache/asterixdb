--  This Test is intended to test the IPartitioningRequirementsCoordinator for outer join
--  in the case where the first delivered properties:( a_0, a_1)
--  and requirement properties: (b_0, b_1)
--  with the following join condition
--  the expected final required properties of orders will be: (b_0, b_1)
use test;



SELECT A.a_0, A.a_1, A.a_2, A.a_3, B.b_3
FROM  A  LEFT OUTER JOIN B   ON (
    A.a_0  = B.b_0
        AND B.b_1 = A.a_1);
