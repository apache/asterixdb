--  This Test is intended to test the IPartitioningRequirementsCoordinator for outer join
--  in the case where the first partition properties:( a_0, a_1, a_2)
--  and requirement properties: (b_0, b_1, b_2)
--  with the join condition A.a_0  = B.b_0 AND B.b_1 = A.a_1 AND A.a_2 = B.b_2 AND A.a_3 = B.b_3
--  No extra hash exchanges are required as its already partitioned on (a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3) & (b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3)
--  As partition on (a_0, a_1, a_2) implies partition on (a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3)


use test;

SELECT A.a_0, A.a_1, A.a_2, A.a_3, B.b_3
        FROM  A  LEFT OUTER JOIN B   ON (
            A.a_0  = B.b_0
                AND B.b_1 = A.a_1
                AND A.a_2 = B.b_2
