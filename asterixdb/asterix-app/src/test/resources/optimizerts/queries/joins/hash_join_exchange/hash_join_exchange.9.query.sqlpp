--  This Test is intended to test the IPartitioningRequirementsCoordinator for outer join
--  in the case where the first delivered properties: (o_w_id, o_d_id, o_id)
--  and requirement properties: (o_w_id, o_d_id, o_id)
--  with the following join condition
--  the expected final required properties of orders will be: (o_w_id, o_d_id, o_id)


use test;



SELECT o.o_d_id, o.o_w_id, o.o_id, o.c_id, o.o_carrier_id, o.o_ol_cnt, c.*
FROM orders o LEFT OUTER JOIN customer c ON (
    c.c_w_id  = o.o_w_id
        AND c.c_d_id = o.o_d_id
        AND c.c_id = o.o_c_id
        AND o.o_carrier_id > 8);
