 * Description  : Create a feed using the synthetic feed simulator adapter.                   
                  Create a dataset that has an associated rtree index.
                  The synthetic feed simulator uses the Social-Data generator to generate data and simulate a feed.
                  The feed lasts a configured duration with data arriving at a configured rate (tweets per second).
                  Verify the existence of data after the feed finishes.
 * Issue        : 711
 * Expected Res : Success
 * Date         : 8th Feb 2014
