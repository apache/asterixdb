 *  Description     : Full-text search index test
 *                  : This test is intended to verify that the full-text search DOES NOT work as expected.
 *                  : query #2 - a string phrase in an unordered list is provided as a query predicate.
 *                  :            this should throw an exception since we don't support a phrase search yet.
 *  Expected Result : Exception
 *
