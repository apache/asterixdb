* Description  : Create an external dataset that contains a tuples, the lines from a large (35kb) text file in HDFS.
                 The input file is sufficiently large to guarantee that # of bytes > than internal buffer of size 8192.
                 This causes a record to span across the buffer size boundaries. 
                 Perform a word-count over the data in the dataset.
* Expected Res : Success
* Date         : 7th Jan 2013
