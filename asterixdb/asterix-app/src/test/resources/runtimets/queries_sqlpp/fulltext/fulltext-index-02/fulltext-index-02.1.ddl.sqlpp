 *  Description     : Full-text search index test
 *                  : This test is intended to verify that the full-text search works as expected.
 *                  : query #3 - two string values in [an ordered list] query with "any" option
 *                  :            in this case, "any" option that enforces a disjunctive search will be applied.
 *                  : query #4 - the same as query #3, but with a different option - "all"
 *                  :            in this case, we explicitly specify "all" option that enforces a conjunctive search.
 *                  : query #5 - two string values in {{an unordered list}} query with "any" option
 *                  :            in this case, "any" option that enforces a disjunctive search will be applied.
 *                  : query #6 - the same as query #6, but with a different option - "all"
 *                  :            in this case, we explicitly specify "all" option that enforces a conjunctive search.
 *                  : query #7 - the same as query #4, but without any option that is equivalent to "all".
 *                  : query #8 - the same as query #6, but without any option that is equivalent to "all".
 *  Expected Result : Success
