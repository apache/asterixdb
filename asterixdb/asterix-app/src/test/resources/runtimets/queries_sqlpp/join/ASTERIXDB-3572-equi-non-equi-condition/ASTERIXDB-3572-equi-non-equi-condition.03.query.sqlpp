 * Similar to hash-join-with-redundant-variable.04.query.sqlpp
 * But with Index NL. The plan of this test should has three
 * hash-partition-exchange (as opposed to test 13 & 14). Because the parallelism
 * is set to 3, then the last join requires both sides to be hash partitioned.
 * Customer will need to duplicate its variable to join both with Nation and Supplier.
 * This is the effect of using Index NL with parallelism != # of partitions
