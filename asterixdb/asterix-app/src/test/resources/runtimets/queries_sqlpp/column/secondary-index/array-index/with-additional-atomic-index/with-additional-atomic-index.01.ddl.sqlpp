 * Description: Verify the following DML actions for an array->atomic index, with an additional atomic index:
 *     1) Insert into an empty index (non bulk-load operation), additionally with two records that have no array-index qualifying entries.
 *     2) Delete all-but-one entry from the index.
 *     3) Upsert all *original* (all records have qualifying array-index entries now) entries into the index.
