* Description  : Create a highly nested datastructure that uses opened and closed datasets
                at different levels. Use open-nested indexes at every level
                to copy from one data set upwards
                check the final result to see if copies were successful all the way up
* Expected Res : Success
* Date         : 20 Oct 2014
