 * Description    : Joins two datasets on the intersection of their point attributes.
 *                  Both inner and outer dataset have an RTree index, and we expect the
 *                  join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join
 *                  by using an RTree index from the inner dataset.
 * Success        : Yes
