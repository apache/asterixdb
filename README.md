## What is AsterixDB?

AsterixDB is a BDMS (Big Data Management System) with a rich feature set that sets it apart from other Big Data platforms.  Its feature set makes it well-suited to modern needs such as web data warehousing and social data storage and analysis. AsterixDB has:

- __Data model__<br/>
A semistructured NoSQL style data model ([ADM](https://ci.apache.org/projects/asterixdb/datamodel.html)) resulting from
extending JSON with object database ideas

- __Query languages__<br/>
Two expressive and declarative query languages ([SQL++](http://asterixdb.apache.org/docs/0.9.1/sqlpp/manual.html)
and [AQL](http://asterixdb.apache.org/docs/0.9.1/aql/manual.html)) that support a broad range of queries and analysis
over semistructured data

- __Scalability__<br/>
A parallel runtime query execution engine, Apache Hyracks, that has been scale-tested on up to 1000+ cores and 500+ disks

- __Native storage__<br/>
Partitioned LSM-based data storage and indexing to support efficient ingestion and management of semistructured data

- __External storage__<br/>
Support for query access to externally stored data (e.g., data in HDFS) as well as to data stored natively by AsterixDB

- __Data types__<br/>
A rich set of primitive data types, including spatial and temporal data in addition to integer, floating point, and textual data

- __Indexing__<br/>
Secondary indexing options that include B+ trees, R trees, and inverted keyword (exact and fuzzy) index types

- __Transactions__<br/>
Basic transactional (concurrency and recovery) capabilities akin to those of a NoSQL store

## Build from source

To build AsterixDB from source, you should have a platform with the following:

* A Unix-ish environment (Linux, OS X, will all do).
* git
* Maven 3.3.9 or newer.
* JDK 11 or newer.
* Python 3.6+ with pip and venv

Instructions for building the master:

* Checkout AsterixDB master:

        $git clone https://github.com/apache/asterixdb.git

* Build AsterixDB master:

        $cd asterixdb
        $mvn clean package -DskipTests


## Run the build on your machine
Here are steps to get AsterixDB running on your local machine:

* Start a single-machine AsterixDB instance:

        $cd asterixdb/asterix-server/target/asterix-server-*-binary-assembly/apache-asterixdb-*-SNAPSHOT
        $./opt/local/bin/start-sample-cluster.sh

* Good to go and run queries in your browser at:

        http://localhost:19006

* Read more [documentation](https://ci.apache.org/projects/asterixdb/index.html) to learn the data model, query language, and how to create a cluster instance.

## Documentation

To generate the documentation, run asterix-doc with the generate.rr profile in maven, e.g  `mvn -Pgenerate.rr ...`
Be sure to run `mvn package` beforehand or run `mvn site` in asterix-lang-sqlpp to generate some resources that
are used in the documentation that are generated directly from the grammar.
