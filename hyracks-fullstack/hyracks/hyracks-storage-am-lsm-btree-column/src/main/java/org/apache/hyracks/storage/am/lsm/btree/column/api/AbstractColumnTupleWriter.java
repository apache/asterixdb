 * Columnar Tuple Writer:

 * {@link #getMaxNumberOfTuples()}
 * Then, the columns are flushed to disk.
 * <p>
 * Contract:
 * - Initially, the writer has to set multiPageOp by calling {@link #init(IColumnWriteMultiPageOp)}
 * - For each write, the caller should check if adding a tuple does not exceed the {@link #getMaxNumberOfTuples()} or
 * the on-disk page size (called stopping condition)
 * - If the stopping condition is reached, then {@link #flush(ByteBuffer, IColumnPageZeroWriter)} needed to be called
 * <p>
 * Hyracks visibility:
 * - Columns are written as blobs (i.e., not interpretable by Hyracks)
 * - Hyracks only aware of where each column at
